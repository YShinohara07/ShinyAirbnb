<p>There's lot of room to further expand this project. Some ideas are, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding markers to map to identify hosts</li>
  <li>Adding more options to the map filter system</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering the scaffolded questions provided by Kaggle uploader.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)</li>
  <li>Which hosts are the busiest and why?</li>
  <li>Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?</li>
</ul>
